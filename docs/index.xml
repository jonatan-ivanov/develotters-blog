&lt;p>Hugo is very flexible in terms of configuration and organizing the content, you have a lot of options and you can do things in various ways. This might sound great but if you ask me, I rather like opinionated things where I don&amp;rsquo;t need to put a bunch of effort in figuring out best practices but the framework gives those to me (Convention over Configurationâ„¢). Unfortunately, this is not the case for Hugo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Build a Blog Like This: Intro</title><link>https://develotters.com/posts/how-to-build-a-blog-intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 20:52:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://develotters.com/posts/how-to-build-a-blog-intro/</guid><description>&lt;p>The whole thing started with: &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;I think I want to create a blog&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. I had a few ones before, those were either all-in-one hosted solutions or self-installed &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress&lt;/a> sites. WordPress was a tempting pick this time (as always) but I&amp;rsquo;ve played a little with &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> recently and I liked them. So I negligently threw the red button with the text &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Deploy WordPress&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> back to the shelf and I brought up a little toolbox that has the text &lt;a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAM Stack&lt;/a> on it from my shed (not &lt;a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/mailing-list-faq/bikeshed.html">&lt;em>bikeshed&lt;/em>&lt;/a>), also I liked the idea of hosting the blog on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://develotters.com/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 20:06:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://develotters.com/about/</guid><description>Hi,
