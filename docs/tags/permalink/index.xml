&lt;p>Hugo is very flexible in terms of configuration and organizing the content, you have a lot of options and you can do things in various ways. This might sound great but if you ask me, I rather like opinionated things where I don&amp;rsquo;t need to put a bunch of effort in figuring out best practices but the framework gives those to me (Convention over Configurationâ„¢). Unfortunately, this is not the case for Hugo.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
