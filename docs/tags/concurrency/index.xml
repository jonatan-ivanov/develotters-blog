In the &lt;a href="https://develotters.com/posts/the-most-common-concurrency-issues-and-how-to-fix-them-part-2/">second one&lt;/a>, I explained the first issue: Race Condition. In this post, I would like to explain the rest of them.
By the end of the series, you will understand their basic mechanism, you will be able to identify them and I will give you a couple of advice on how to fix them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote a few tests to demonstrate two of the issues, the third one is tough, please let me know if you have any idea how can it be tested. I&amp;rsquo;m also interested if you have any ideas for improvements for the existing tests because…&lt;br>
…well, keep reading and you will see. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Most Common Concurrency Issues and How to Fix Them: Part 2</title><link>https://develotters.com/posts/the-most-common-concurrency-issues-and-how-to-fix-them-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://develotters.com/posts/the-most-common-concurrency-issues-and-how-to-fix-them-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://develotters.com/posts/the-most-common-concurrency-issues-and-how-to-fix-them-part-1">first part&lt;/a> of the series, I showed you a simple class which has three concurrency issues.
