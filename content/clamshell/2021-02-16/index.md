# Devnexus
[Devnexus](https://devnexus.com/) is the Largest Java Conference in the USA; this year it is a free, online event that takes place on 17th February (EST). Talks will be presented without interruption, after each there will be a live discussion session with the speaker.

# The new features in Java 16
Due in March, the next Java upgrade targets primitive classes, sealed classes, records classes, a vector API, ports for Windows on ARM64 and Alpine Linux, and other new features. You can read about them in the article [JDK 16: The new features in Java 16
](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3569150/jdk-16-the-new-features-in-java-16.html)

# What's new in Spring Boot 2.4
I completely forgot about this, [Spring Boot 2.4](https://spring.io/blog/2021/01/17/what-s-new-in-spring-boot-2-4) came out in January. :)

# github1s
One second to read GitHub code with VS Code: just add 1s after github in the URL and press Enter in browser address bar for any repository you want to read, e.g.: [github1s.com/microsoft/vscode](https://github1s.com/microsoft/vscode)

# Welcome to VS Code for Java
VS Code, a.k.a. Visual Studio Code, is a modern editor available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It supports many languages and runtimes including Java. Besides editing features like IntelliSense, Code Action, etc., developers and students also like its lightweight, modern UI, extensibility, and the comprehensive support of remote development. Also, itâ€™s free. [The article](https://foojay.io/today/welcome-to-vs-code-for-java/) walks you through how to get started for Java on VS Code.

# TeaVM
[TeaVM](http://teavm.org/) is an ahead-of-time compiler for Java bytecode that emits JavaScript and WebAssembly that runs in a browser. Its close relative is the well-known GWT. The main difference is that TeaVM does not require source code, only compiled class files. Moreover, the source code is not required to be Java, so TeaVM successfully compiles Kotlin and Scala.

# Java Ecosystem Survey 2021
Just like in 2020, [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) is creating a comprehensive Java 2021 report that reflects the state of the JVM ecosystem.
Check out summary of the [JVM Ecosystem 2020 report](https://snyk.io/blog/jvm-ecosystem-report-2020) and fill out the [JVM Ecosystem 2021](https://snykteam.typeform.com/to/ZHuh7NzJ) survey.
