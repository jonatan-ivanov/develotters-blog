# How my photo ended up breaking Android phones

A [story](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52978884) about how rounding errors and color space conversion errors break Android. See a mode detailed explanation on XDA: [This wallpaper triggers a rare bug causing Android devices to bootloop](https://www.xda-developers.com/wallpaper-triggers-rare-bug-causing-android-devices-bootloop)

# Folders Language

[Folders](http://danieltemkin.com/Esolangs/Folders/) is a language where the program is encoded into a directory structure. All files within are ignored, as are the names of the folders. Commands and expressions are encoded by the pattern of folders within folders. Source code for the Folders compiler can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/rottytooth/Folders).

# Pluto

[Pluto](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/pluto) is a very simple utility to help users find deprecated Kubernetes apiVersions in their code repositories and their helm releases.

# Dropbox is working on its own password manager

Dropbox just uploaded a new app to the Play Store without any formal announcement. The new [Dropbox Passwords](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/04/dropbox-is-working-on-its-own-password-manager/) app, according to its listing, is a password manager available exclusively in an invite-only private beta for some Dropbox customers.

# National Emergency Library

The [National Emergency Library](https://archive.org/details/nationalemergencylibrary) is a temporary collection of books that supports emergency remote teaching, research activities, independent scholarship, and intellectual stimulation while universities, schools, training centers, and libraries are closed.

# PHP Turns 25

JetBrains created a nice timeline which shows the past [25 Years of PHP History](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/php-25/).

# The 25 greatest Java apps ever written

From space exploration to genomics, from reverse compilers to robotic controllers, Java is at the heart of todayâ€™s world. Here are a few of the countless Java apps that stand out from the crowd: [The 25 greatest Java apps ever written](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/the-top-25-greatest-java-apps-ever-written) by [Alexa Morales](https://twitter.com/WorlWindWriting)

# Java's Migration to GitHub

[Project Skara](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/skara/)(see: [wiki](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/SKARA)) was created to investigate alternative SCM and code review options for the JDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than Mercurial. Two connected JEPs were also created:
- [JEP 357: Migrate from Mercurial to Git](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/357)
- [JEP 369: Migrate to GitHub](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/369)

and now both are proposed to target JDK 16, check out the [latest project updates](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~rwestberg/skara/skara_status_update_2020_05_07.pdf).
