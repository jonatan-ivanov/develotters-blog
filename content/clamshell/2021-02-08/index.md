# Upptime
[Upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime)is the open-source uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by GitHub Actions and Issues.

# Exfiltrating Data from Air-Gapped Computers via Wi-Fi Signals (Without Wi-Fi Hardware)
A security researcher has demonstrated that sensitive data could be exfiltrated from air-gapped computers via a novel technique that leverages Wi-Fi signals as a covert channel—surprisingly, without requiring the presence of Wi-Fi hardware on the targeted systems: [Exfiltrating Data from Air-Gapped Computers via Wi-Fi Signals (Without Wi-Fi Hardware)](https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/exfiltrating-data-from-air-gapped.html)

# Electronic CS textbooks
[Colin S. Gordon's list](https://csgordon.github.io/books.html) is a loosely-categorized collection of links to CS textbooks in a variety of areas that are freely available online.

# bettercap
[bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/intro/) is a powerful, easily extensible and portable framework written in Go which aims to offer to security researchers, red teamers and reverse engineers an easy to use, all-in-one solution with all the features they might possibly need for performing reconnaissance and attacking WiFi networks, Bluetooth Low Energy devices, wireless HID devices and Ethernet networks.

# tmpsms
[tmpsms](https://github.com/sdushantha/tmpsms) is a command line utility written in POSIX `sh` that allows you to get a temporary phone number and receive SMSes. It uses [Upmasked](https://upmasked.com/) temporary SMS service in order to receive the messages. This is a very useful tool for those testing applications during bug bounty hunting or who just need some privacy and don't want to use a personal phone number. This is easy to use with simple outputs. tmpsms can be integrated with other scripts to improve your workflow.

# Naming Cheatsheet
Naming things is hard. [This cheatsheet](https://github.com/kettanaito/naming-cheatsheet) attempts to make it easier.
Although these suggestions can be applied to any programming language, it uses JavaScript to illustrate them in practice.

# Wasmer is Generally Available
[Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/) is an open-source runtime for executing WebAssembly on server-side. [Wasmer 1.0 is now generally available](https://medium.com/wasmer/wasmer-1-0-3f86ca18c043)
