# Vector API is proposed to target JDK 16

The goal of the [Vector API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/338) is expressing vector computations that reliably compile at runtime to optimal vector hardware instructions on supported CPU architectures and thus achieve superior performance to equivalent scalar computations. This API is [targeted to JDK 16](https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/jdk-dev/2020-August/004646.html).

# Developing Micronaut Applications With IntelliJ IDEA

# Changelog CI?
[Changelog CI](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/changelog-ci) is a GitHub Action that generates changelog. Then the changelog is prepended to CHANGELOG.md file and committed and/or commented to the release Pull request.


# K9s - Kubernetes CLI To Manage Your Clusters In Style

[K9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. The aim of the project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage your applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.
